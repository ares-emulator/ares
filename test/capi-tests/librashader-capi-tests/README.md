# C API examples and testing playground

These examples are merely illustrations of how to use `librashader_ld.h`. The actual "rendering" parts of it should not be taken as "good" or well optimized code.

* `librashader-capi-tests` This is my playground to test the soundness of bindings.
* `dx11-example` This is a basic D3D11 example.
* `dx11-example-2` This is a more advanced D3D11 example based off [Minimal D3D11 pt3](https://gist.github.com/d7samurai/abab8a580d0298cb2f34a44eec41d39d) to show integration with a more complex renderer.
