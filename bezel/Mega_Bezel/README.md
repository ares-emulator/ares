**Intro**
----------------------------------------

This shader package is meant for you to experiment with and make your own creations if you like. Try adjusting the shader parameters to change the look, as most things are adjustable for personal taste. The base package is now part of the Libretro repo but there will also be updates coming periodically which may get a pre-release here before they go into the main repo. 

----------------------------------------
----------------------------------------
---------------------------------------- 
**Installation - VERY IMPORTANT, PLEASE READ**
----------------------------------------

***
**INSTALLING THE BASE MEGA BEZEL PACKAGE**
* **You MUST use Retroarch Version 1.9.8 or Later** (It will fail to load on earlier versions)
* **If you want to use the default Mega Bezel included with Retroarch:**
  * Use **Online Updater -> Update Slang Shaders** to update the shaders, the shaders will be added here `Retroarch/shaders/shaders_slang/bezel/Mega_Bezel`
* **If you want to install from a zipped release from the link above:**
  * If the `shaders/shaders_slang/bezel/Mega_Bezel` folder exists delete it
  * Inside the .zip is a **Mega_Bezel** folder. Copy the Mega_Bezel folder into your `Retroarch/shaders/shaders_slang/bezel` folder (If the bezel folder isn't there you can create it)
  * The final path to the Mega bezel should be `Retroarch/shaders/shaders_slang/bezel/Mega_Bezel`

***
**RETROARCH SETUP**
  * Set video driver to **Vulkan** or GLCore if Vulkan is not available
  * It will run in **GLCore** but seems faster in **Vulkan**
  * **D3D IS NOT RECOMMENDED**. If it loads in D3D it has a VERY slow load time
  * Restart Retroarch after changing the video driver
* Open the **Settings** Menu and Set:
  * **User Interface / Show Advanced Settings** to **ON**
  * **Video / Scaling / Aspect Ratio** to **Full**
    * This will match your monitor aspect aspect ratio
  * **Video / Scaling / Integer Scale** to **OFF**
  * **Video / Output / Video Rotation** to **Normal**
  * **Core / Allow Rotation** to **OFF** -- **Important for FB Neo**
  * For **FB Neo**
    * Turn **vertical mode OFF** in **Quick Menu > Core Options** if it was previously turned on
  * **Do all of this before loading content**
* For **FB Neo**
  * **If your game is vertical** set the Rotate CRT Tube parameter to 1. If it is now upside down set Flip Core Image Vertical and Horizontal to 1 

***
**LOADING AND SAVING PRESETS**
  * **Load a preset** in the shaders menu. 
      * The Mega Bezel shader presets are found in: `Retroarch/shaders/shaders_slang/bezel/Mega_Bezel/Presets`
  * **IMPORTANT!!** When saving a preset make sure you have the **Simple Presets** feature set to **ON**
    * This will save a preset with a reference to the preset you loaded plus whatever parameter changes you made
    * This will keep your presets loading properly when the shader updates in the future

***
**EDITING PRESETS**
  * You can then open this Simple Preset file and add other parameter adjustments or set textures as you see fit. E.G. add the following lines to change the background image: 
    * `BackgroundImage = "MyImage.jpg"`
  * Or change the path indicated on the `#reference` line to point at a different base preset

***
**INSTALLING ADDITIONAL PRESET/GRAPHIC COLLECTIONS**
  * Create a folder named `Mega_Bezel_Packs` in the root of the shaders folder, the final path of this should be `Retroarch/shaders/Mega_Bezel_Packs
  * Place any of the additional collections inside this folder
  * For example the final path to the examples pack should be `Retroarch/shaders/Mega_Bezel_Packs/HSM_Mega_Bezel_Examples`

**THANKS TO THE SHADER WRITERS!**

The Mega Bezel sits atop the shoulders of giants and uses a number of amazing shaders written by shader writers from the community:
  * Guest.r (Guest-Advanced crt shader)
  * EasyMode
  * CGCW (LCD Grid)
  * DariusG (GDV Mini)
  * Dogway (Grade Color Correction)
  * Hyllian (SGENDPT)
  * Aliaspider (GTU)
  * Sp00kyFox (MDAPT & ScaleFX)
  * Trogglemonkey (Royale 3D Curvature)
  * Flyguy (Text Shadertoy)
  * Special thanks to Hunterk for porting a number of these and helping me with his expertise along the way!


***
**THANKS TO THE MEGA BEZEL GRAPHICS ARTISTS PUSHING THE FEATURES DURING DEVELOPMENT**

The Mega Bezel would also not have gotten to this level of sophistication without some intense feedback from graphics experts pushing the features and finding the holes.

  * @Duimon
  * @TheNamec
  * @Soqueroeu

***
**THANKS TO THE GRAPHICS ARTISTS WHO HAVE INSPIRED US**

And of course I probably would never have started this without seeing the great overlays created previously 
  * @OrionsAngel
  * @exodus123456

----------------------------------------
----------------------------------------
----------------------------------------
**What does it do?**
----------------------------------------

  * Adds an auto-generated bezel around the screen with reflection
  * Enable easier use of bezels and more "natural" presentation
  * Ease of use for screen scaling and automatic aspect ratio with existing shaders
  * Provide a consistent set of enhanced features wrapped around the core crt shaders
  * Layering images to add artwork and visual effects

----------------------------------------
**How does it work?**
----------------------------------------

  * In general there is a background image which fills the screen, then the scaled down game screen with an automatically generated bezel image is drawn on top. 
  * The bezel and frame you see around the screen is auto generated and not part of the background image
  * Additional Images can be layered on top to augment the look
  * Most things can be changed to your taste with adjustment of the parameters, so try them out!

----------------------------------------
----------------------------------------
**Choosing a Preset**
----------------------------------------

  * Presets are named/sorted by performance
  * The most flexible and most resource hungry start with index 0.
  * As the name's index number increases the performance of the preset improves but but flexibility decreases.
  * The presets with the lowest performance requirements are:
    * MBZ__3__STD__GDV-MINI - This has a Dynamic Bezel and Reflections
    * MBZ__4__STD-NO-REFLECT__GDV-MINI - This Has a Dynamic Bezel but No Reflections
    * MBZ__5__POTATO__GDV-MINI - This has no Dynamic Bezel and no Reflections
----------------------------------------

**Presets in Mega_Bezel / Presets**
----------------------------------------

- All in the root of the Presets folder use @guest.r's awesome Guest-Advanced CRT shader which is considered the default CRT shader for the Mega Bezel, the only exception to this is the POTATO preset which uses GDV-MINI for performance reasons. The following table is sorted by GPU performance and GPU RAM requirements

  * **STD Pre-CRT shader chain** 
    * Includes Some Basic Processing before the CRT shader
  * **ADV Pre-CRT shader chain** 
    * Includes STD chain and adds DeDithering & GTU
  * **ADV Pre-CRT shader chain + ScaleFx Upres** 
    * Includes ADV Pre-CRT shader chain and ScaleFX
    * Resolution is tripled in the middle of the chain for ScaleFX
    * This requires increased GPU processing
  * **SCREEN-ONLY**
    * Includes whatever the category's Pre-CRT shader chain but removes the bezel, images and reflection
  * **Glass** 
    * Presets which show a blurry reflection in the area around the screen

    * All presets include Tube Effects except the Potato

**Preset Folders in Mega_Bezel / Presets**

  * **Base_CRT_Presets**
    - Includes presets using different crt shaders for the screen
    - Look here for the LCD preset

  * **Base_CRT_Presets_DREZ**
    * Presets which set the resolution at the beginning of the shader chain
    * Good for reducing the resolution from the core to native res to use with a crt shader
    * Helps working with cores which are outputting at increased internal resolution, e.g. 2x, 4k. When a large image comes from the core and is downscaled to ntive res this creates antialiasing, helping smooth out the jaggies


**HSM Examples Package (Separate additional Package from Mega Bezel)**

  * **Community_CRT_Variations**
    - Presets with crt settings created by community members
    - Thanks to some of our community members who's settings appear here including @BendBombBoom, @NesGuy, @Sonkun & @Cyberlab

  * **Variations**
    * These presets are simple presets referencing one of the presets in the Mega_Bezel folder
    * They reference the original preset then have adjusted parameters or texture paths

  * **Experimental**
    * **Use at your own risk!**
    * These presets are work in progress and are likely to be moved, renamed, dissappear or change behavior at any future release


----------------------------------------
----------------------------------------
----------------------------------------
**Troubleshooting**
----------------------------------------
---

 * **If you have difficulties loading the shader** try loading it with the imageviewer core
    * **Steps**
        * Add the imageviewer core to Retroarch with the online updater
        * Open an image with this core
        * Load the shader
        * If the shader loads correctly then the shader is working.
        
     * If Retroarch crashes this is usually the core resolution overwhelming the graphics card's resources. This more often happens when you are using a SMOOTH-ADV preset. Try a STD, or STD-DREZ preset to reduce the resolution used within the shader chain
     * When the shader works in imageviewer, but doesn’t work when using a core, it is probably related to the core
     * If you still have difficulties loading the shader with a specific core, try updating the core
     * If you still have difficulties download a new separate version of Retroarch and try it there. Sometimes problems lurk in a random config file which is very hard to track down
 * **To see errors** coming from Retroarch you need to set up your logging settings:
    * **Logging - Logging Verbosity - ON**
      * **Frontend Logging - 0(Debug)**
      * **Log to File - ON**
      * **Restart Retroarch**
      * **Load your shader**
      * **Close Retroarch**
      * These last steps allow you to have a short log for us to look at
      * If you want to see the errors as they happen you can set Log to File to OFF and an additional console window will open when retroarch opens and show errors here
    

---
**If the Screen is changing size unexpectedly**

  * If the screen changes size when loading a game or switching between different parts of the game e.g. gameplay vs cinematic, this is because of the interaction between the different resolutions the core is outputting on different screens and the shader's integer scale or automatic aspect ratio settings.
    
* **How to fix**
  
  * **Make sure Integer Scale is OFF in the RetroArch Video Settings**
  * **If BOTH the HEIGHT and WIDTH of the screen size are changing size**
    
    * Set the Integer scale mode to OFF (0)
  * **If ONLY the WIDTH of the screen is changing size** (the HEIGHT stays constant)
    * Set the Aspect Ratio Type to Explicit (1) This will use the explicit aspect ratio number instead of guessing
    
    * If this solves your issue please consider posting on the thread at the top of this document the issue you had so that we can improve the auto aspect ratio in the future

---
**If the Screen is shown in a vertical aspect for a horizontal game:**

  * Set The **[ Aspect Ratio ] / Orientation** to **Horizontal**

---
**If you see artifacts on the game image like circles or interference patterns**
  * These artifacts which look like round swirls or circles like tree trunk rings are called a Moiré patterns which happen when a high frequency pattern is sampled at a lower frequency - https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moiré_pattern

    * The base cause of the Moiré pattern is usually the curvature in combination with visible scanlines

* **How to fix**
    * Set **CRT Curvature Scale Multiplier** to 0, This will remove curvature from the game image but leave everything else the same
    * Set **Integer Scale Mode** to 1 or 2
    * Make the game screen larger with either **Viewport Zoom** or **Non-Integer Scale %**
    * Use a higher resolution monitor if available

----------------------------------------
----------------------------------------
----------------------------------------
**Bug Reporting**
----------------------------------------

* When reporting a bug, it is VERY IMPORTANT to post images of the issue. This helps communicate the issue better & quicker, even if the issue seems simple.
*  Please make sure you are using the latest version of the shader
* Please include info about your setup
  * Preset, Core, Core Internal Res 1x, 2x etc?, Monitor resolution, GPU
*  If you are having any issues with the shader not loading or crashing please include a log. See the readme for how to get a log
  * If loading the shader crashes Retroarch your core internal res is probably too high. Try native resolution or one of the DREZ presets which reduce the resolution in the first pass.

**Parameter Descriptions**
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
**[ --- HSM MEGA BEZEL X.X.XXX 20XX-XX-XX --- ]:** - Title, Version, Date

  * **Show Resolution Info** --- Show Resolution info from different aspects of the shader chain with onscreen text

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
**[ CRT BRIGHTNESS & GAMMA ]:**
  * **Gamma In (Game Embedded Gamma - Gamma Space to Linear) Def 2.4** - The gamma adjustment applied to take the core image and bring it into linear color space. Gamma to Linear Space Decode
  * **Gamma Out (Electron Gun Gamma - Linear to Gamma Space) Def 2.4** - The gamma adjustment applied to the CRT shader's linear color output to bring it back into a gamma corrected space. Also known as Linear to Gamma Space Encode
  * **Post CRT Brightness** - Brightness adjustment on the CRT color output (Applied in Linear Color Space)
  * **Post CRT Brightness Affects Grade Black Level** - As this value is reduced the brightness adjustment amount will be reduced on the black level. So if you set it to a low value there will be almost no increase in brightness on the areas which were black before the black level adjustment.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
**[ GRAPHICS GLOBAL BRIGHTNESS ]:**
  * **Graphics Brightness** - Brightness of all graphics and images which are not the CRT Shader
  * **Graphics Gamma Adjust** - Gamma adjustment on all graphics and images which are not the CRT Shader to adjust brightness with a gamma curve

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
**[ AMBIENT LIGHTING ]:** - Usually used to apply night lighting on all graphics
- **Ambient 1st Image Opacity**
  - How much of the ambient lighting darkening effect is applied when using the first image
- **Ambient 2nd Image Opacity**
  - How much of the ambient lighting darkening effect is applied when using the second image
* **Which Images to Use** 
  * **0 - BOTH** - Normal Mode, Use Both Images
  * **1 - 1 ONLY** - Use the first image for both slots
  * **2 - 2 ONLY** - Use the second image for both slots
  * **3 - Swap** - Swap the Images


-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
**[ SINDEN LIGHTGUN BORDER ]:**
  * **Show Border** - Show the white border around the inner edge of the tube
  * **Brightness** - How bright is the border
  * **Thickness** - How Thick is the border
  * **Compensate Empty Tube**
    * **0 - Don't adjust the tube size and puts the white border on top of the CRT image**
    * **1 - Adjust the tube to be wider so the white border is outside the CRT image**


-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
**[ VIEWPORT ZOOM ]:** 
* **Viewport Zoom** --- Zoom in or out on everything
* **Zoom CRT Mask** --- When this is on and we zoom in the crt phosphor mask will also scale in integer steps
* **Viewport Position X**
* **Viewport Position Y**

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
**[ FLIP & ROTATE ]:**

* **Flip Viewport Vertical** --- Some cores flip the viewport (full monitor area), this flips it back
* **Flip Viewport Horizontal**
* **Flip Core Image Vertical** --- Some cores flip the core image, this flips it back
* **Flip Core Image Horizontal**
* **Rotate CRT Tube** --- Turns the tube 90 degrees counter counter-clockwise

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
**[ ASPECT RATIO ]:**

* **Orientation** --- Should the aspect be tall or wide? This does not rotate the image.
  * **0 - Auto** - Chooses vertical vs horizontal based on the core resolution
  * **1 - Horizontal** - uses horizontal aspect
  * **2 - Vertical** - uses vertical aspect

* **Type**
  * **0 - Auto** - Choose aspect ratio based on an educated guess about the core's resolution
  * **1 - Explicit** - Use the aspect ratio from the **Explicit Aspect Ratio** parameter
  * **2 - 4:3** - Almost all arcade games are 4:3
  * **3 - 3:2**
  * **4 - 16:9**
  * **5 - PAR** - The aspect ratio of the core's pixel resolution
  * **6 - Full** - The screen will scale to the full viewport

  * **Explicit Aspect Ratio** - Ratio used when [Aspect Ratio] Type is set to Explicit or if Auto is chosen and no matching resolution can be found

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
**[ CRT SCREEN SCALING GENERAL ]:**

- **Integer Scale Mode**
  - **0 - OFF** Use Non-Integer Scale
  - **1 - ShortAxis Integer Scale On** - for the viewport (monitor) in landscape mode this is the vertical axis, If the screen/tube aspect ratio is vertical then integer scale is used for both horizontal and vertical axes
  - **2 - Integer Scale on both axes**

- **Preset is for Monitor Portrait Mode (Smaller CRT Screen)**
  - Turn on if this preset is to be used on monitor in Portrait mode, E.G. if your physical monitor is turned vertical

**[ INTEGER SCALE ]:**

- **Base Integer Scale Max Height %**
  - The maximum screen height of the default integer scale when integer scale is on

- **Integer Scale Multiple Offset**
  - Adjusts the size of the screen by increasing the multiple of the core resolution (on both axes) when using integer scale, to make the screen larger or smaller

- **Integer Scale Multiple Offset Long Axis**
  - Adds an additional multiple offset but for only the long axis, with a horizontal aspect ratio this is the horizontal axis

**[ NON-INTEGER SCALE PERCENT  ]:**

- **Non-Integer Scale %**
  - If integer scale isn't used, this sets the vertical size of the vertical percentage of the full viewport. The default is 82.97 which corresponds to an exact integer scale of 224p content

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
**[ NON INTEGER - PHYSICAL SIZES ]:**

- **Use Physical Monitor and Tube Sizes for Non-Integer**
  - Use these physical sizes instead of the integer scale percentage

- **Your Monitor's Aspect Ratio**
  - The aspect ratio of your physical monitor, most monitors are 1.77 which equates to 16:9

- **Your Monitor's Size (Diagonal)**
  - The size of your physical monitor

- **Simulated Tube Size (Diagonal)**
  - How big you want the crt screen to be on your monitor


-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
**[ NON-INTEGER - AUTOMATIC SCREEN SCALE & PLACEMENT ]:**

- **Use Image For Automatic Placement (Scale and Y Pos)**
  - When on the placement image is inspected to find where to place and scale the screen image
- **Auto Place Horizontal (X Pos)**
  - 0 - OFF  Screen placed in the center 
  - 1 - ON Tries to place the screen in the center of the hole in the placement image
- **Placement Image Mode: TRANSPARENCY : WHITE ON BLACK**

## ***Common Layer Parameters***

	*Many parameters which repeated from layer to layer, their description is shown here*

- ***Opacity***
  - *Opacity multiplier of the layer being applied. 0 means we will not see the layer because it is fully transparent*

- ***Colorize On*** - Turns on the Colorization
- ***Hue*** - The hue adjustement, eg more blue vs red
- ***Saturation***
- ***Brightness***
  - *Adjust Brightness of the Layer, 100 is no change*
- ***Gamma***

- ***Ambient Lighting Multiplier***
  - How much of the global ambient lighting to add to the layer

- ***Apply Ambient Lighting in ADD Blend Mode***
    - By default when a layer is in ADD mode ambient lighting is not applied to the image, this works well for things like LEDs
    - When **Apply Ambient Lighting in ADD Blend Mode** is set to 1 the ambient lighting will be applied when in ADD blend mode

- ***Blend Mode*** *- How the image is applied to the layer underneath Default is 1: Normal Blending*

  - ***0 - Off*** *- The layer is not shown*
  - ***1 - Normal Blending***
  - ***2 - Additive Blending*** *- Applied additively to brighten what's underneath*
  - ***3 - Multiply Blending*** *- Applied to as a darkening of what is underneath*

- ***Source Matte Color***
  - *Controls how the image transparency is interpreted based on the matte color used when the image was stored (what color the image is blended with in the transparent area).*
  - *Used to remove white fringing on the edges around transparent areas.*
  - ***0 - Black***
    - *The color in the transparent area was black*. Technically this is called Premultiplied alpha. 
  - ***1 - White***
    - *The color in the transparent area was white, Use this if you see white fringing on the edges of the transparency where there should be none.*
  - ***2 - None***
    - *The image was not blended with any matte color, the only transparency info is in the alpha channel*

- **Mask** - Mask the layer with the area inside the:
  - ***0 - ALL*** *- Whole viewport*
  - ***1 - Screen*** *- Illuminated area of the tube*
  - ***2 - Tube*** *- Inside the tube
  - ***2 - Bezel and Inward*** *- Bezel and inward*
  - ***3 - Bezel*** *- Bezel
  - ***4 - Bezel +*** *- Bezel and outward*
  - ***5 - Frame*** *- Frame
  - ***6 - Frame +*** *- Frame and outward*
  - ***7 - Background***  *- Outside the frame*

- ***Cutout Mask***
  - ***0 - OFF*** *- Don't cut out any area of the layer*
  - ***1 - ON*** *- Make the area of the layer INSIDE the cutout mask transparent*
  - ***2 - Invert*** *- Make the area of the layer OUTSIDE the cutout mask transparent*

- ***Dual Screen Visibility*** - Where to show this image
  - ***0 - Show on Both Screens***
  - ***1 - Show only on Screen 1***
  - ***2 - Show only on Screen 2***

- ***Follow Layer***
  - *Controls if this layer follows another layer's scaling* 
  - ***Full / Fullscreen*** *- Scale to the viewport*
  - ***Tube*** *- Follow the Tube Scaling*
  - ***Bezel*** *- Follow the Bezel Scaling*
  - ***Background*** *- Follow the Background Image Scaling*
  - ***Bezel Image*** *- Follow the Bezel Image Scaling*
  - ***Decal Image*** *- Follow the Decal Image Scaling*
  - ***Top Extra Image*** *- Follow the Top Extra Image Scaling*

- ***Follow Mode***
  - *Controls if this layer follows another layer's scaling* 
  - ***Follow Scale and Pos*** *- Follow Scale and Position, ignore split*
  - ***Follow Exactly*** *- Match the layer exactly including split*

- ***Follow Full also follows Zoom***
  - When the layer Follow Layer is in **FULL** mode this controls if the layer should scale with the global zoom or not, this defaults to ON

- ***Image Fill Mode***
  - **0 - USE TEXURE ASPECT** --- Keeps the aspect of the teture
  - **1 - SPLIT HORIZONTAL** --- Splits the image in the center and slide it out towards the sides to match the required aspect
  - **2 - STRETCH** --- Stretch the image across the whole area to match the required aspect

- ***Split Mode Preserve Center %*** --- Preserves a part of the center of the graphic when split is used
  - One usage is to have a logo in the center of the bottom of the monitor graphic and reserve space for this

- ***Split Mode Repeat Width %*** --- Width of repeating texture in exposed area 
  - When this is 0 repeat is off

- **Scale** --- *Scales image layer equally in both directions*
- **Scale X** --- *Scales image layer horizontally*
- **Position X** --- *Moves the image layer horizontally*
- **Position Y** --- *Moves the image layer vertically*
- **Mipmapping Blend Bias** --- *Adjusts the sharpness of the image*

**[ --- SMOOTHING - SCALEFX ---- ]:**

**ScaleFX ON** applies a shape smoothing on the core image and creates a higher resolution smoothed image
  - After you turn this on you must increase **Core Res Sampling**, or **Downsample Blur** in the next section to see a difference
  - ScaleFX only works well when the it's input is the native res from the core
  To see the contour smoothing coming from **ScaleFX** either **Core Res Sampling**, or **Downsample Blur** must be increased from their default value.
