Before submitting an issue, please use the search to make sure an issue doesn't already exist, you should also make sure your rom is not a bad dump, by comparing against the hashes in the No-Intro (Cartridges) or Redump (CD-ROM) databases.

**Describe the issue**
A clear and concise description of what the bug is.

**Rom Information**
Specify the impacted rom filename and any associated hashes (sha256 preferred);.
The easiest way to do this is to open the game in ares, and go to "Tools -> Manifest" and copy/paste the contents.

```
file: Some Game (REGION).ext
sha256: <hash>
```
