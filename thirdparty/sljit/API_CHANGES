This file is the short summary of the API changes:

21.04.2022 - Non-backward compatible
    Floating point comparison types are renamed.

01.03.2022 - Non-backward compatible
    Remove SLJIT_NEG. Instead substraction from
    immedate 0 is preferred.

31.01.2022 - Non-backward compatible
    The SLJIT_CURRENT_FLAGS_ADD_SUB option is
    split into SLJIT_CURRENT_FLAGS_ADD and
    SLJIT_CURRENT_FLAGS_SUB.

27.02.2022 - Non-backward compatible
    The SLJIT_F64_ALIGNMENT option is removed.

17.02.2022 - Non-backward compatible
    Many floating point operations may destroy flags.

06.02.2022 - Non-backward compatible
    The SLJIT_FUNC_OFFSET macro is renamed to SLJIT_FUNC_ADDR.
    Furthermore a new SLJIT_FUNC_UADDR macro is added which
    returns with an unsigned address.

01.02.2022 - Non-backward compatible
    Rework function argument list descriptor macros used by
    sljit_emit_enter, sljit_set_context, sljit_emit_call,
    and sljit_emit_icall functions.

25.01.2022 - Non-backward compatible
    Change SLJIT_I32_OP and SLJIT_F32_OP to SLJIT_32.

24.01.2022 - Non-backward compatible
    The SLJIT_UNUSED value is replaced by sljit_emit_op2u and
    sljit_emit_return_void functions.

27.05.2021 - Non-backward compatible
    The comparison types with the 32 suffix are removed from the
    project. The sljit_set_current_flags has a new flag which
    must be set when the flags are set by a 32 bit operation.

04.05.2021 - Non-backward compatible
    The mul overflow comparison type is removed from the project
    and the normal overflow type should be used instead.

28.04.2021 - Non-backward compatible
    The current_flags argument of sljit_set_current_flags must
    provide information about the instructions which set the CPU
    status flags.

16.08.2020 - Non-backward compatible
    A second parameter has been added to sljit_create_compiler()
    and sljit_free_code() to pass some data to the executable
    allocator functions.

24.01.2020 - Non-backward compatible
    The SLJIT_MOV instructions does not support SLJIT_UNDEFINED
    as destination. New prefetch instructions has been added
    instead.

20.01.2019 - Non-backward compatible
    The check_sljit_emit_fast_return function is removed, and
    this operation is available through check_sljit_emit_op_src.

16.01.2019 - Backward compatible
    A new opcode (SLJIT_ENDBR) is added to support
    Intel Control-flow Enforcement Technology (CET).

08.01.2018 - Non-backward compatible
    Fields of sljit_stack are renamed to fit a
    top-down stack better.

02.01.2018 - Non-backward compatible
    Immediate source argument has not been supported
    for NOT, NEG, CLZ, and fast_return instructions
    anymore. No CPU supports immedate arguments for
    these opcodes.

26.12.2017 - Non-backward compatible
    The MOVU opcodes are removed because the emulation
    is inefficient. The sljit_emit_mem() operation is
    added instead.

18.10.2017 - Non-backward compatible
    The SLJIT_CALL0 - SLJIT_CALL3 jump types are
    replaced by sljit_emit_call and sljit_emit_icall
    function calls. These functions allows declaring
    the argument types.

06.05.2017 - Non-backward compatible
    Src argument is removed from sljit_emit_op_flags.

24.04.2017 - Non-backward compatible
    The sljit_is_fpu_available function is replaced
    by sljit_has_cpu_feature.

20.04.2017 - Non-backward compatible
    x86 specific cmov is changed to a general function

27.03.2017 - Non-backward compatible
    JIT stack is changed from bottom-up to top-town.

15.01.2017 - Non-backward compatible
    Move with update may modifiy flags, the base register
    can only be used once and [reg+reg<<shift] addressing
    mode where shift > 0 is not supported anymore.

12.01.2017 - Non-backward compatible
    Introducing a new flag mechanism which provides better
    compatibility with CPUs without flags. Only two flags
    remain: zero and variable. The current type of the
    variable flag is specified by the arithmetic operator.
    The SLJIT_KEEP_FLAGS is removed.

29.02.2016 - Non-backward compatible
    Several types and instructions are renamed to improve
    readability. In general byte, half, and int are renamed
    to 8, 16, and 32. Floating point types are also renamed
    from d and s to f64 and f32.

      [s|u]b -> [s|u]8    (8 bit values)
      [s|u]h -> [s|u]16   (16 bit values)
      [s|u]i -> [s|u]32   (32 bit values)
      d -> f64            (64 bit floating point value)
      s -> f32            (32 bit floating point value)

18.05.2015 - Non-backward compatible
    SLJIT_[I|]L[U|S]DIV is renamed to SLJIT_[I|][U|S]DIVMOD

29.09.2014 - Non-backward compatible
    The sljit_create_compiler, sljit_allocate_stack, and
    sljit_free_stack functions have an allocator_data
    argument now.

19.09.2014 - Non-backward compatible
    Using I, D, S prefixes in conditional and floating
    point operations. And an L prefix to long multiplication
    and division (op0 opcodes).

11.08.2014 - Non-backward compatible
    A currently unused options parameter is added to sljit_emit_enter
    and sljit_set_context.

06.07.2014 - Non-backward compatible
    SCRATCH registers are renamed to Rx and SAVED registers
    are renamed to Sx. See the explanation of these registers
    in sljitLir.h.

31.05.2014 - Non-backward compatible
    SLJIT_TEMPORARY_EREGx registers were not renamed to
    SLJIT_SCRATCH_EREGx when the change was done on 08.11.2012

05.03.2014 - Backward compatible
    The sljit_set_target now supports those jumps, which
    does not created with SLJIT_REWRITABLE_JUMP flag.
    Reason: sljit_emit_ijump does not support conditional
    jumps.

03.03.2014 - Non-backward compatible
    SLJIT_MOV_UI cannot be combined with SLJIT_INT_OP.
    Reason: SLJIT_INT_OP flag is not recommended to use
    directly, and SLJIT_IMOV has no sign bit.

29.01.2014 - Backward compatible
    Bits assigned to SLJIT_MEM and SLJIT_IMM flags are changed.
    Reason: the most common cases are fits into one byte now,
    and more registers can be supported in the future.

08.11.2012 - Non-backward compatible
    SLJIT_TEMPORARY_REGx registers are renamed to SLJIT_SCRATCH_REGx.

07.11.2012 - Non-backward compatible
    sljit_emit_cond_value is renamed to sljit_emit_op_flags. An
    extra source argument is added which will be used in the future.

05.11.2012 - Backward compatible
    sljit_emit_cond_value now supports SLJIT_AND and SLJIT_INT_OP
    flags, which makes this function complete.

01.11.2012 - Non-backward compatible
    SLJIT_F* opcodes are renamed to SLJIT_*D to show that
    they are double precision operators. Furthermore
    SLJIT_*S single precision opcodes are added.

01.11.2012 - Non-backward compatible
    Register arguments of operations with SLJIT_INT_OP flag
    must be computed by another operation with SLJIT_INT_OP flag.
    The same way as SLJIT_SINGLE_OP flag works with floating point
    numbers. See the description of SLJIT_INT_OP.

01.11.2012 - Backward compatible
    All operations whose support the SLJIT_INT_OP flag, have an
    alternate name now, which includes the SLJIT_INT_OP. These
    names starting with I.

31.10.2012 - Non-backward compatible
    Renaming sljit_w to sljit_sw, sljit_i to sljit_si, sljit_h
    to sljit_sh, and sljit_b to sljit_sb. Reason: their sign
    bit is part of the type now.

20.10.2012 - Non-backward compatible
    Renaming SLJIT_C_FLOAT_NAN to SLJIT_C_FLOAT_UNORDERED.
    Reason: all architectures call these unordered comparions.
