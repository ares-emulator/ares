#    Koko-aio shader is meant to be an all-in one crt shader.
#    It can be configured with many parameters, so that can be
#    scaled to run on even on modest gpus while still developed to
#    run with heavier presets on at least Haswell+ iGpus.
#    It is not meant to simulate the internal behaviour of CRT displays,
#    but to give users the parameters to make their monitors to look similar.
#    Several presets are included.

#    Actually it provides emulation for:
#        scanlines, screenlines, RGB vertical masks, horizontal slot masks,
#        glowing, haloing, blooming, gamma and SATURATION correction,pixel_outi        
#        black frame insertions, interlace emulation, antialiasing.

#    External code by:
#    * Nvidia (FXAA)



    
# Bezel texture contains the following infomations:
#   - The red channel represents the luminance information
#   - The green channel represents the highlights
#   - The alpha channel in the inner frame represents the part of the bezel that will be filled by the game content
#   - The blue channel represents the part of the bezel that will be filled by the game reflection.

# This pass emulates the flickering observed on crts when the input signal is interlaced
# and there is high brightness difference between adiacent scanlines.
# It also emulates the RF noise.
#
# Also, it upscales the input signal to 2X and optionally applies an edge smoothing algorithm.
# Koko-aio will then work internally at 2X, which is needed by several following filters.
# However, if the input signal is already at sufficient resolution, there is no need to scale to 2x
# and it is possible to gain performance by turning the scale to 1x.
#
# A special note for P-UAE core (Commodore Amiga), is needed, because it outputs by default to
# 720 pixel width and about 280p; this means that for P-UAE you can use scale_x1 = 1.0
# and only scale_y1 = 2.0 is needed.
# As an alternative option you can configure P-UAE to always output to low resolution for x and y
# But this way you loose the emulation for hires content (not much games uses it anyway).
