    //      in input register 0x02 for further info on ignored pause requests. It isn't directly tied to the input register however,
    //      as it is set by the unit itself after a drive state change of 0x4 is processed, to load a disk. After this process is
    //      complete, this bit is set automatically, so that the disk is left with a paused read at the start of the disk content.
    // *U30: Current mechanical drive state. See input register 0x02 for further information. This register reports the current
    //       drive state, which may be different from the requested drive state.
    //       -Note that state changes to invalid state numbers are ignored, and do not change the number reported here.
    //       -Note that due to a possible bug, when a drive state of 0x2 is requested, to close the drive tray, that number
    //        always becomes effective here, even if the drive was already closed and video is currently playing. This is in
    //        contrast to a drive state request of 0x4, to load a disk, which does not appear here if a disk is currently playing.
    //       -Note that when a drive state request of 0x4 is being processed, this register first reports 0x4 when the disk is
    //        being loaded into the mechanism, then 0x5 when the laser moves and the disk starts to spin up, and a small read is
    //        performed (probably the TOC), then 0x4 again just before the command is complete. The state of U7 remains set to
    //        true through this process. Another case of this has also been observed. If the disk has only just been loaded into
    //        the tray, but never loaded until now, this register reports a code of 0x2 almost immediately, then once the disk is
    //        finished being loaded into the mechanism, it transitions to 0x4, and stays on this code for the duration of the
    //        operation, even during the seek and read process for the TOC.
    //       -Note that if a drive state request of 0x4 fails, IE, because of a mechanical problem loading the disk, or a digital
    //        problem determining the disk type or content, the current drive state transitions to 0x2, and the disk stops spinning.
    //        This also applies if no disk is currently in the drive. The state transitions to 0x2 almost immediately in this case.
    //       ##OLD## DRVOPEN doesn't do anything if this is set to 1. DRVINIT also compares this to 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5.

    //      -Changing the value of this bit while input registers are unfrozen, or the effective value compared to
    //       the previously latched value when input registers are being unfrozen, triggers a seek operation.
    //      -It is only the transition that matters for this behaviour, IE, it was 0 but is being set to 1, or it
    //       was 1 but is being set to 0.
    //      -There is no detected difference between 0 and 1 for this register bit yet, however we expect there may
    //       be a difference to discover with further testing, now that we know there's a connection with seeking.
    // ##ENDNEW##
    // *U7: Apply register writes. When this bit is cleared, most register writes are not latched, and do not take
    //      effect until this register is modified to set this bit to true, at which point, those register writes
    //      take effect. Note that the last written data can still be read back by reading the current values of the
    //      input registers, they just don't take effect on the hardware immediately.
    //      -Note that the way this is implemented, when this register is set with this value set to true, all
    //       affected registers simply get applied immediately, whether they've changed or not. If seeking is
    //       enabled, this also means that a seek operation will be performed immediately at this point, whether
    //       any seeking registers were modified while register writes were disabled or not. ##NOTE## As of 2025-07,
    //       we now know this note is incorrect. We do not see this immediate application with seeking being
    //       performed, rather, we now believe this was mistakenly being seen due to us changing U0 at the same time,
    //       which we now know can trigger a seek if its value is different after being unfrozen than it was before
    //       being frozen.
    //      -Note that not all input registers can have their writes delayed. The LD and VDP graphics faders, as well
    //       as U0 of register 0x19, have all been confirmed to take effect immediately, regardless of the state of
    //       this register. Other registers may exhibit similar behaviour.
    //      -##NEW## 2025 - We have confirmed that both U7 and U6 update regardless of U7 state, while U0 does not
    //       take effect unless U7 is set.
    //      ##TODO## Test all registers to confirm how they interact with this setting
    // *U6: Freeze output registers. When this bit is set, the output register block retains the same values, and
    //      they do not change until this bit is cleared. Note that while the output registers are frozen, they
    //      can all be written to in code, and read back again with the new values. These modifications have no
    //      apparent effect, and the correct output values are restored when the registers are unfrozen.
    //      ##NOTE## 2025 - Output register 0x00 bits U7 and U6 do not retain written values when the output registers
    //      are frozen, however U0 does. All other registers retain written values in all bits when output registers
    //      are frozen, and immediately update when they are unfrozen.
    //      ##OLD# Preserved when reading, modifying, and writing back this register. Seen to be set explicitly at
    //      0x1E98, and cleared explicitly at 0x1EFA.
    // *U0: Unknown. When this register is written to with U7 set, the first output register bit 0 latches the value

    //       -0x7: Tests show this works like play, except it doesn't do anything if the current drive state is not 0x5. No error
    //             flags are set to indicate failure if this is not the case, it simply doesn't do anything, and output register 0x06
    //             continues to report the previously active drive state. Note that even when correctly applied from drive state 0x5,
    //             the active drive state stays at 0x5. This then acts more like a command than an active state.
    // -We've confirmed operationErrorFlag3 is cleared when the seek mode changes too
    //##OLD## Before 2025
    // *U7: Flags the CD tray to be opened when an open command is sent and this register is set, otherwise the LD tray is opened.
    //      See the description of the open command for further notes.
    // *U5: Perform seek. When a drive code 0x5 is issued and this bit is set, the drive seeks to the last requested position through
    //      the location registers and begins playback from there, discarding the current read location. If this bit is set, any changes
    //      to the current seek mode or target seek location registers will, in most cases, trigger an immediate seek operation to the
    //      specified target.
    //      ##TODO## Do more testing on exactly which registers trigger seeking immediately and under which modes.
    //      ##OLD## Cleared at 0x2CF6. Set in ROMSEEK.
    // *U4: Pause playback. When a drive code 0x5 is issued and this bit is set, any current read operation seems to be paused, and the
    //      LD video output is blanked. The read resumes from the current location as soon as a drive code 0x5 is issued again with
    //      this bit clear.
    //      -Note that this bit is ignored if the drive tray is currently open and a drive code 0x5 is issued, and instead, the disk
    //       starts playing when it is loaded. This is really a firmware bug, but that's how the hardware behaves.
    //      -Note that this bit is only effective when it transitions between 0 and 1 and a valid drive code is issued along with it.
    //       For example, if a disk is currently playing and an invalid drive code of 0x8 is issued, the playback is not paused. If a
    //       drive code of 0x5 is then issued and U4 is set however, playback will not be paused either. Playback can only be paused
    //       again if a valid drive code is issued with U4 cleared, after which another drive command can then be issued with U4 set
    //       to pause playback.
    //      ##OLD## Set in ROMSEEK
    // *U30: Requested mechanical drive state. Setting this register causes a drive request to be performed. The following state
    //       codes have been observed:
    //       -0x7: Unknown. Never seen as the active state, but safe for use with pause/resume. See U4 for more info.
    //       -0x5: Play disk. The exact behaviour of this state depends on the state of U4 and U5 when this state change is
    //             requested. This command closes the tray and spins up the disk if required.
    //       -0x4: Load disk. Causes the currently present disk in the tray to spin up. This command does nothing if a disk is
    //             already spinning, and U4 in output reg 0x09 is set.
    //       -0x3: Unload disk. Causes the disk to stop spinning. Does nothing if this is already the case.
    //       -0x2: Closes the drive tray, either the CD or LD tray, whichever one is open. Does nothing if no trays are open.
    //       -0x1: Opens the drive tray. Does nothing if the tray is already open. Note that whether the CD or LD drive tray is
    //             opened depends on the state of U7. If U7 is set, the CD tray is opened, while the LD tray is opened if U7 is
    //             clear. Note also that if an LD is currently in the drive tray, the state of U7 is ignored, and the LD tray is
    //             always opened. If a CD is in the drive tray however, either the LD or CD tray can be opened. The CD tray sits
    //             within the LD tray, so it's possible to remove a CD from the drive by opening the LD tray, but the reverse is
    //             not true.
    //       -0x0: Unknown. Never seen as the active state, but safe for use with pause/resume. See U4 for more info.
    //       No other drive codes appear to be valid, based on observed behaviour such as output register 0x09 bit 4, and the
    //       paused read state change behaviour.
    // Note: ROMSEEK Sets this register to 0x35 as the last step when performing a seek operation. It is also implied
    //       that bits 4 and 5 are separate from each other and from the lower 4 bits, as these bits are set separately.
    // ##NOTE##
    // -This register actively changes output register 0x0E
    // -Other bits in this register actively effect things. We've seen seeks not play automatically, seeks not re-seek if we're currently playing from that location, etc. More testing required.
    // -This register also seems complex. If we're playing with the register data set to 0x25, then we scroll back from 0x20 to 0x15, nothing happens, but if we jump straight to 0x15, playback stops.
    //  If we then scroll up to 0x20, playback resumes. 0x17 has the same effect.

    // If no actual change has occurred to the "important" bits in this register, don't do anything. We do this because
    // it's important that the error flags are not cleared if no real change has taken place, nor is a seek operation
    // performed when writing a value of 0x25 after writing a value of 0x65 for example. It appears that changes to the
    // lower six bits cause things to effectively change/re-run, while writes to the upper two bits do not. LDRom2 games
    // rely on this, to ensure the error flags are not cleared after reaching a stop point just because register writes
    // are suspended then restored for example, but the same property is true and valid here with just writing to the

    //  complete and a single new frame has been shown, both the reverse bit and the rate will be set to 0x0, so the
    //  output reg will read 0x20 if either 0x21 or 0x29 is written once the step has been processed, even though the
    //  reverse bit is effective in controlling the step direction.
    // -Toggling bit 0 of input reg 0x00 will cause the frame skip/step to be run again for rate 0x01. In the case of
    //  frame skip, this causes the output register to toggle its "reverse" bit again, so if it was previously on 0x19,
    //  after processing the frame skip again, it will now be 0x11, even though input reg 0x03 hasn't changed. In the
    //  case of frame step mode, it will apply just as before, with the current effective value of input reg 0x03 being
    //  output to output reg 0x07, until the step has been processed, at which time it will revert to 0x20.
    // -Freezing then unfreezing the input register block does not cause skipping/stepping to occur again, unless input
    //  reg 0x00 bit 0 has also had its effective value changed.
    // -Note that the live state of input reg 0x03 is used when toggling bit 0 of input reg 0x00. If the last attempted
    //  write to this register set an invalid playback mode, toggling bit 0 of input reg 0x00 will not cause frame skip
    //  or step at rate 1 to advance while invalid data is in input reg 0x03.
    // -Note that "bouncing" back and forth between 0x11 and 0x19 will cause the frame skip mode to advance by 1, with
    //  the direction bit in output reg 0x07 toggling, just like if we toggled bit 0 of input reg 0x00.

    //                 register 0x09. The one slight exception to this rule, certainly a hardware bug, seems to be that if any invalid
    //                 target is selected, regardless of the state of any of the other bits in that write attempt to this register, if
    //                 fast forward mode is currently active, and the current step speed is 0x3 or above, when the invalid target is
    //                 written, the current playback mode, step direction, and step speed, will all revert to the last settings that
    //                 were applied which were not setting up a fast forward operation with a step speed of 0x3 or above. This occurs
    //                 regardless of the old or new step direction setting, and regardless of how many writes have occurred to setup a
    //                 fast forward operation with a step speed of 0x03 or above, since the previous settings being reverted to were
    //                 active.
    //       -0x3: Fast forward. When this setting is enabled, frames will advance faster than the normal rate, at a rate specified by
    //             bits 0-2. See the notes for these bits for additional info.
    //       -0x2: Frame stepping. When this setting is enabled, audio output is disabled, and frames will automatically advance at
    //             the rate specified by bits 0-2.
    //       -0x1: Frame skipping. When this setting is enabled, during playback, the audio plays as normal, but the video skips frames
    //             at the specified rate. The overall speed of playback is the same, but the image will only update at the interval
    //             specified.
    //       -0x0: Normal playback.
    // *U3: Step direction. When fast forward or frame stepping are active and this bit is set to 1, stepping occurs backwards,
    //      otherwise it occurs forwards. This bit is ignored for frameskip mode.
    // *U20: Step speed. This has no effect under normal playback mode, but when frame stepping or skipping is active, this controls
    //       the rate at which updates occur. The following are the observed rates:
    //       -0x7: ~0.33r FPS instead of 30 (30 seconds for 10 frames) - Display frame 90x
    //       -0x6: 1 FPS instead of 30 (45 seconds for 45 frames) - Display frame 30x
    //       -0x5: 1.875 FPS instead of 30 (48 seconds for 90 frames) - Display frame 16x
    //       -0x4: 3.75 FPS instead of 30 (24 seconds for 90 frames) - Display frame 8x
    //       -0x3: 7.5 FPS instead of 30 (24 seconds for 180 frames) - Display frame 4x
    //       -0x2: 15 FPS instead of 30 (12 seconds for 180 frames) - Display frame 2x
    //       -0x1: 1 frame only. The image will not update after the initial frame. Note that under frame step mode, output register
    //             0x07 will report this step speed as 0x1 only until the single frame step has been performed, after which, the output
    //             register will now state a value of 0x0. Also note that under frame skip mode, the output register will output 0x19 for
    //             an input register state of 0x11, in other words, the "direction" bit is set to "reverse" when a 1-frame frame skip mode
    //             is activated.
    //       -0x0: 0 frames. This pauses playback in frame stepping mode, and performs a normal playback in frame skipping mode.
    //       Under fast forward mode, this register is applied differently. The following are the observed rates in fast forward:
    //       -0x7/0x06: Search mode. Plays 0.75 seconds of footage forwards in time, with audio, then jumps either forward or back
    //        4 seconds from the resulting point. Note that setting this register to 0x07 is the same as 0x06, but 0x06 is the value
    //        that is reported back as the current mode in either case by output register 0x07.
    //       -0x5: 20x speed
    //       -0x4: 14x speed
    //       -0x3: 8x speed
    //       -0x2: 3x speed

Well, not when the drive state is changed to 0x05 or 0x25, that will perform the seek to chapter. Rather, when the seek mode is changed to 0x00 or 0x04, or any of the following regs 0x07-0x0B are written to when seek mode is 0x00 or 0x04, reg 0x09 will be set to 0x11.

    //	-##FIX## 0x04 just worked with seeking to a start time from a track beginning!
    //	-Maybe it picks up the last valid seek point?
    //	-Correction to above: Chapter 0x00 is the same as seeking to the FIRST chapter. On a multi-disc setup the first chapter number may not be 0.
    //	-Additionally, if seeking is enabled, and a valid seek target is not set for seeking to with this mode, when trying to transition from drive state 0x04 to 0x05, the attempt will fail with output reg 0x09 set to 0x11, and the player will remain paused. Actually, this only happens if the drive has previously been at state 0x04 or above, with the TOC loaded. If you attempt this from a drive state of 0x01 for example, or a drive state of 0x03 or less when the TOC has never been loaded, the attempt to play will succeed, the drive will transition to state 0x05, but it will play from the beginning.

    //       behind displayed regions of the LD image stream where this is used. If an area of the LD image stream is used, it appears the
    //       following 8-12 or so "pixels" of the LD image output following it will be displayed too, even if they are black. This is an
    //       unstable effect, and is affected by the intensity of the colour output prior to the transition to black. There is also a
    //       "lead-in" effect which is less extreme, where the intensity of the "black" preceding a colour, and the intensity of that colour,
    //       affect how long it takes before the LD image actually appears instead of the VDP image. It appears that even for high intensity
    //       transitions, at least 1-2 pixels are lost from the output image on average before the LD video stream gains priority. A "rainbow
    //       effect" is also often visible on the first lead-in pixel. All these issues make this mode most likely very difficult to use in a
    //       useful way for a real game, especially since the "black level" between the LD video stream and the VDP image is very different,

  // frame will be shown when we turn the image hold bit back on again. This shows that we do need to latch new frames
  // when the player is paused, even if the output is normally blanked in pause mode.

  // when the video is disabled, then image hold is turned on, with video disable still active, a new frame cannot be
  // latched yet. If we then perform a seek for example, then turn off the video disable bit, the next frame to be shown

  // new frame when the video disable bit is set, and remains in a "pending" state until the next frame arrives.
